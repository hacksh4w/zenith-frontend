## Project Description
Problem: Young individuals, navigating the transition into adulthood, often find themselves ill-equipped to manage their finances effectively. The complexities of student loans, cost-sharing with friends, accumulating debts, and balancing daily expenses can lead to financial stress and missed opportunities.

Solution: This comprehensive fintech app simplifies the path to financial success for people of all ages. It acknowledges the unique challenges faced by today's youth and provides a user-friendly platform for setting and achieving their financial requirements. Users can easily input their desired financial objectives, prioritise them, and share details about their monthly income or allowances. With this app, we empower individuals to take control of their financial future, just as older generations plan for their retirement
